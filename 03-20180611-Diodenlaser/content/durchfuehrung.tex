To make Further observation with a laser, you have to attitude it first. 
First thing to do is to calibrate the current to achieve a population inversion. 
For makeing the laser light visible the laser is pointed to a buisnesscardholder
which is filmed by a ccd sensor.

\end{figure}
To achieve the minimal current to laser by induce emission, aternately the head
knob and side knob position is optimized.
Everythime stimulated emission is produce, current is shutting down power a
little bit. 
So that the last visible induce emission is the minimal laser current. 
A Note for stimulated emission is that the light cone from induced emission is
much brighter and more homegenous than by spontanious Emission.
One Example for induce \ref{fig:induce} and spontanious \ref{fig:spontanious} light cone is shown in picture \ref{fig:emission}.

\end{figure}
The meassured current for the minimal threshold is \SI{30}{\milli\ampere}.
By moving both knobs over full range, no flashes can be generated.


\subsection{Anregen Rubidium}%
\label{sub:anregen_rubidium}

To stimulated the rubidium Gas beam Angle has to pass the chamber so that no
light is ideal sprinkeld at the border of the chamber. 
In Figure \ref{fig:hole_emission} is shown how the measureing instrumente have to be
arrange to measure the light intensity.
\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{build/rubidiumemission.pdf}
		\caption{}
		\label{fig:hole_emission}
\end{figure}
The Voltage of the photo diode is increased and shown on an oszilloskop. 
The side knob have to be calibrate to attain the right frequenz for stimulated
the gas. 
For reducing the contrast a gratting is put in the beam so that the beamangle
can be seen with help of a ccd Camera. 
Right frequenz is be found if in the Camera a small beam is visible. 
The middle beam of side knob variation should be choosen because it had the
srongest gain.
An example for ionizing Gas is shown in figure \ref{fig:ionized}.
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
Aim after the Robidium is stimulated is to meassure the absorption spektrum. 

\subsection{Absorbtion Spektrum}%
\label{sub:absorbtion_spektrum}

A absorption Spektrum is dependence from the frequence. 
To achieve a variation in frequence a pieco element is used. 
The piezo element is on the diffraction gratting to variated the length of the
external resonator. 
Varation of resonator length causes shifts in laser frequenz.
